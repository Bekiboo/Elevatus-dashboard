# Overview

I developped this project to learn React and Next.js. This project is a simple dashboard for the Elevatus non-profit organization. It displays the lists of donors, employees and children receiving help, as well as details for each of them.
Use the following commands to run the project:

`pnpm install`

`pnpm run dev`

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
